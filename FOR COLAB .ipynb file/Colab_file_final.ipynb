Its performance significantly impacts the durability and strength of structures.

Understanding the specific type of cement, its appropriate application based on environmental conditions (e.g., sulphate attack), and adherence to water-cement ratio requirements are critical for achieving the desired concrete properties.\\n\\nThe document also emphasizes the need for proper storage, batching, and mixing procedures to maintain cement quality and consistency. Factors such as cement content, mineral admixtures (e.g., fly ash), and curing methods are highlighted as essential considerations for producing durable cement concrete. Regular testing and inspection of cement properties, as outlined in the document, are necessary to ensure compliance with specifications and prevent material rejection.\",\n          \"Coarse aggregate, generally retained on a 4.75 mm IS Sieve as per IS 383, can be stone, gravel, or brick aggregate.
